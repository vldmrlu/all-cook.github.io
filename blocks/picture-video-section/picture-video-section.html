                <h2>How does LOW CARB diet work for weight loss?</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>25-30% of daily energy should come from carbohydrates, 2 times less than the recommended standard diet.</li>
                    <li>Our bodies metabolise carbohydrates for energy and save the excess of it in the form of fat.</li>
                    <li>Reducing the consumption of carbs makes your body consume energy from the stored fat.</li>
                    <li>The rule is to consume nutrient-rich carbohydrates, such as vegetables and pulses, which our body takes longer to metabolise.</li>
